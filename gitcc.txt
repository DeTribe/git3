If you think someone might be using your Wi-Fi without your permission, there are several ways to check. Here are some steps you can follow:

1. Check your router’s device list
Most modern routers allow you to see a list of devices that are currently connected to your network. Here’s how to do that:

Log in to your router’s admin page: To do this, type the router's IP address into your web browser. Common router IPs are 192.168.1.1, 192.168.0.1, or 192.168.1.254. You’ll need your admin username and password (usually found on the router itself or in its manual).

Find the list of connected devices: Once logged in, look for a section labeled something like "Device List," "Attached Devices," "LAN Status," or "Client List." This should show all the devices connected to your Wi-Fi network. The list will typically show the device name, IP address, and MAC address.

Identify unfamiliar devices: Look through the list and see if any devices are unfamiliar or if there are more devices connected than you expected.

2. Use a network scanning app
You can also use a third-party network scanner to check for unauthorized devices. Some popular options are:

Fing (iOS/Android): Fing is a popular app that scans your network and provides a list of devices connected to it. It can also give you more details like device types and IP/MAC addresses.
Advanced IP Scanner (Windows): A free tool for Windows that scans your network and lists all connected devices.
3. Check your Wi-Fi usage
If you’re experiencing slow internet speeds, this could be a sign that someone else is using your connection. Some routers even have bandwidth monitoring features that allow you to check which devices are using up the most bandwidth.

4. Look for unusual behavior
If you’re noticing odd network behavior (e.g., slow speeds, device lag), it could be a sign that someone is using your Wi-Fi. Additionally, check if your data usage has increased unexpectedly.

5. Change your Wi-Fi password
If you do find unauthorized devices, the best way to secure your network is to change your Wi-Fi password. After doing this, you'll need to reconnect all your devices using the new password.

Update your password to WPA3 or WPA2 (WPA2 is fine if WPA3 isn't available on your router). Avoid using simple or easily guessable passwords.
Enable network encryption (WPA2/WPA3 encryption is standard) to ensure that only devices with the correct password can connect to your Wi-Fi.
6. Disable WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup)
Some routers have a feature called WPS that allows easy connection of devices without entering a password. This can be a security risk, so it’s best to disable it in your router settings.

7. Set up a guest network
If you need to allow visitors or other trusted people to use your Wi-Fi, consider setting up a separate guest network with its own password. This keeps your main network more secure.

If you do find unknown devices and can't identify them, it's worth taking action to secure your network immediately by changing the password, and possibly even resetting the router to factory settings to clear any unauthorized configurations.

If someone is using your Wi-Fi without your permission and trying to hide their presence, there are a few tactics they might use. Here’s how they could potentially evade detection and what you can do to identify them:

1. Changing Device Names or MAC Addresses
How it works: Some devices allow users to change the name of the device or even "spoof" their MAC address (a unique identifier assigned to each device’s network adapter). By doing this, a person could disguise their device as one you recognize, or make it harder to spot among the list of connected devices.
What you can do:
If you're using a router that displays both the device name and MAC address, cross-check the MAC address with known devices. Every device (phone, laptop, etc.) has a unique MAC address. If you suspect someone is spoofing it, you could check the physical MAC address on each device by looking at the network settings or labels, then compare it to the router's list.
Some routers allow you to block specific MAC addresses from connecting. If you identify an unfamiliar MAC address, you can block it in your router settings.
2. Using Static IP Addresses
How it works: Someone could manually configure their device with a static IP address that matches your router's IP range. This way, their device won’t show up as "new" or "unusual" when it connects, since it always uses the same IP.
What you can do:
Look for any IP addresses in the router’s list that seem out of place. If you're not sure which IPs are yours, check the IP range your router uses (usually something like 192.168.1.x).
You can also limit the number of IP addresses that your router can assign to new devices (usually referred to as DHCP lease). This prevents unauthorized devices from connecting once all available IPs are used up.
3. Using Hidden SSID (Wi-Fi Network Name)
How it works: Some attackers might configure their device to connect to your network even if the Wi-Fi name (SSID) is hidden. When an SSID is hidden, the router doesn't broadcast the Wi-Fi name, making it harder for you to see the network.
What you can do:
Enable SSID broadcast: Ensure that your router is broadcasting the SSID (network name). If it's hidden, someone trying to access your network would need to know the exact SSID and password in advance. You can re-enable the SSID broadcast in your router settings if you’ve previously hidden it.
Check for devices with a blank or generic SSID: Some devices that connect to a hidden network will have a generic name or even show no name at all.
4. Connecting via Ethernet (Wired Connection)
How it works: Someone could bypass your Wi-Fi entirely by using an Ethernet cable to connect directly to your router. This would make their device unnoticeable in the Wi-Fi device list.
What you can do:
Physically check the router: Look for devices connected to the router via Ethernet cables. Many routers have indicators or lights that show which ports are in use.
You can also limit Ethernet access by enabling port security or by setting up MAC address filtering to restrict which devices can use the Ethernet ports.
5. Using VPN or Proxy
How it works: If someone connects to your Wi-Fi and uses a VPN (Virtual Private Network), it can make it harder to detect their online activity since the VPN encrypts the traffic and hides the device’s real IP address. They can also change their device’s IP address using proxy servers.
What you can do:
A VPN hides the device’s internet activity but not its connection to your local network. So, while you might not see what they’re doing online, you should still be able to see their device on your network (through the router’s device list or an app like Fing). However, if they're using a proxy or VPN, it may show up as an unfamiliar device or IP in the list.
You could monitor unusual behavior (e.g., high bandwidth use or unknown devices using a lot of data) and try to correlate it with the devices on your network.
6. Not Using a Password or Using a Weak One
How it works: If your Wi-Fi password is weak (or you’re using an easily guessable one), someone could have gained access without you realizing it. If they're tech-savvy, they may avoid detection by not engaging in behavior that would raise suspicion.
What you can do:
Change your Wi-Fi password immediately to something more complex (use WPA3 or WPA2 encryption). Avoid common passwords or easily guessable ones.
Enable WPA2 or WPA3 encryption: This ensures that only devices with the correct password can connect. WPA3 is more secure than WPA2, but if your router doesn't support it, WPA2 is still fine.
7. Disabling Network Monitoring Features
How it works: Some individuals could disable certain router features, like notifications or monitoring tools, that alert you to new device connections. This would make it harder for you to notice when they join the network.
What you can do:
Enable alerts: Many modern routers can notify you via email or app if a new device joins the network. Turn on these alerts in the router settings, if available.
Update router firmware: Make sure your router's firmware is up-to-date to ensure you have the latest security features and fixes.
8. Use of Hidden or Secondary Routers
How it works: If someone has physical access to your home, they could set up a second router connected to your existing one, effectively bypassing the network controls of the main router. This would allow them to access your Wi-Fi without it showing up on your primary router’s device list.
What you can do:
Physically inspect your network setup: Look for any additional routers or access points that shouldn’t be there. If you find an unfamiliar router, it could be used to extend access to your network.
Disable features like Wi-Fi repeaters or extenders if you're not using them, or secure them with a separate password.
Quick Steps to Secure Your Wi-Fi:
Change your Wi-Fi password to something strong and complex (use WPA2 or WPA3 encryption).
Monitor your router’s device list regularly and cross-check unfamiliar devices.
Enable alerts to notify you when new devices connect to your network.
Disable WPS to prevent unauthorized connections using the “easy connect” feature.
Use MAC filtering (if needed) to restrict which devices can connect.
Reset your router to factory settings if you're unsure about any settings or security holes.
If someone is intentionally trying to hide their presence on your network, it can take some effort to track them down. But with a combination of these methods, you should be able to secure your network and identify unauthorized devices.
